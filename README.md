Hello Mixels fans, I just want to let you know about that our idea has come for a plan, To all source coders!

A exciting new Website called "Mixels Hub" has become a big planned built-website called Mixelstube until I failed 
to use it on Wiki Fanon Page, I assume that if you built this soruce code as login in or 
sign up account like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and more social medias, it's best to start off with something 
pleasant about the Built-in Website called "Mixeltube" which is a alternative website of Youtube which I hatred to this one, Of course this was 
my content after all so if 
you just make a Login account to make source codings, It's best 
to start something great like uploading Mixels videos, randomness, memes, crappy contents and more!

As you can, I've set up a pretty image icon and logo from the interactive website of Mixelstube which I've would be discussing about 
my personal content throughout the weeks and months making terrific source codings of New websites, 
You'll know I am doing something else to make an exciting details about how we bring back and now returning Mixels like FNF and more!

The website can make a source free setup website from the creator makers of gaming contents, submissions, uploads, account details and more 
of Source codings to do, If you find it interesting, 
This will give support to all Mixels who are awaiting to the return of all Mixelstubes and Mixels Hub!

We've decided to make all languages to Mixels Hub and Mixelstube which will avaliable to your active 
country like Españols, Portguese, Dutch, Français, Italia, Duestch, Polski Hungary, Slovakia/Slovenia, 
Scandinavia, Balkan, Greece, Romania, Ukraine, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia & Fedestration of Russia.

As you live in Asia since you like Mixels, There is a new bulit-up website that there is a great examples for 
putting source codings from other Asian Countries like only things avaliable from your active place like China, Japan, 
South Korea (new built-up website including Korean), 
Taiwan, Hong Kong/Macau, Vietnam, Philippines, Cambodia, Thailand/Laos/Burmese, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Bangladesh, India, Sri lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan and likely more of 
western asians like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, 
Oman, Israel, Bahrain and more of those famous countries.

This will be used in your website like Morocco, 
Algeria, Tunsia, Libya, Egypt and South Africa!
